Summary

The Parser class is responsible for parsing information from a website that contains recipes.
It uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML response.
The parsed information is then used to create instances of the Dish class, which represents a dish with various attributes such as title, description, ingredients, recipe, etc.

Example Usage

parser = Parser()
dishes = parser.parse_chapters()
for chapter in dishes:
    for dish in chapter:
        dish.output()
